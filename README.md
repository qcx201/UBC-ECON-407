# ECON-407: Topics in Macroeconomics

This repository contains my notes, problem set solutions, and replication project of the SIR-Macro model for **ECON-407: Topics in Macroeconomics** with Professor Peifan Wu at the University of British Columbia.

### Replication
The SIR-macro model developed by **Eichenbaumn, Rebelo, and Trabandt (2020)** incorporates utility optimization decisions by the representative agent in the economy during an epidemic into the standard susceptible, infected, and recovered (SIR) epidemiology model.

The main innovation is modeling the trade-off between consumption utility from labor income and the risk of infection and death, which results in lower productivity if infected and zero remaining life-time utility in the case of death.

I [replicate their model}(https://github.com/qcx201/UBC-ECON-407/blob/main/Final%20Project_ECON-407_Xie%2C%20Jack.ipynb) results in python using a dynamic programming approach.
