# ECON-407

This repository contains my ECON-407 notes, problem sets, and replication project on the SIR-Macro model.

### Replication
The SIR-macro model developed by **Eichenbaumn, Rebelo, and Trabandt (2020)** incorporates utility optimization decisions by the representative agent in the economy during an epidemic into the standard susceptible, infected, and recovered (SIR) epidemiology model. Their main innovation is modeling the trade-off between consumption utility from labor income and the risk of infection (and death) which results in zero discounted life-time utility.

I replicate their model results in python using a dynamic programming approach.
